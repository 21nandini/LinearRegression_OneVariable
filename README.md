# LinearRegression_OneVariable
The specific folder contains an example of using linear regression to predict profits for goods truck.This contains these files:
* TrainingSet.txt
* computeCost.m
* gradient.Descent.m
* run.m
* plotData.m

### How to use this code:
- Install Octave or Matlab
- Fork this repository and clone it locally
- Navigate to the folder with the above files
- Type run in Octave or Matlab command line
- Output contains linear regression to predict profits for goods truck with several graphs:
     - Graph of data
     - Graph of cost function
     - Graph of minimal theta values for hypothesis equation

### Linear regression in one variable review:
The training set contains the dataset for this prediction.The first column is the population of city and the second column is the profit of a goods truck in that city.A negative value of profit column indicates loss.
